# cmddepot

cmddepot is a small .NET utility that allows you to quickly copy & paste frequently used commands.
For example, you are working in a terminal and you have to repeat certain commands. 
While you can use **!history** command and then execute the command with **!<cmd_no>**, for me it's much easier
to copy & paste that command into the terminal.
